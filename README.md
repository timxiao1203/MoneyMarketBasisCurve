# MoneyMarketBasisCurve
A money market basis swap is an exchange of two floating rate notes referencing two different rate indices (indices can differ just by the length of underlying term, like USD 3 Month LIBOR versus USD 1 Month LIBOR, or by nature altogether, like USD 3 Month LIBOR versus USD 3 Month CD).
